# Machine_Learning

Machine learning is a sub-category of artificial intelligence and effectively automates the process of analytical model building and allows machines to adapt to new scenarios independently.

Machine learning is incredibly complex and how it works varies depending on the task and the algorithm used to accomplish it. However, at its core, a machine learning model is a computer looking at data and identifying patterns, and then using those insights to better complete its assigned task. 
Any task that relies upon a set of data points or rules can be automated using machine learning, even those more complex tasks such as responding to customer service calls and reviewing resumes.
Depending on the situation, machine learning algorithms function using more or less human intervention/reinforcement. The four major machine learning models are supervised learning, unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning.
With supervised learning, the computer is provided with a labeled set of data that enables it to learn how to do a human task. This is the least complex model, as it attempts to replicate human learning.
With unsupervised learning, the computer is provided with unlabeled data and extracts previously unknown patterns/insights from it. There are many different ways machine learning algorithms do this, including:
With semi-supervised learning, the computer is provided with a set of partially labeled data and performs its task using the labeled data to understand the parameters for interpreting the unlabeled data.

With machine learning in general, there is some human involvement in that engineers are able to review an algorithm’s results and make adjustments to it based on their accuracy. Deep learning doesn't rely on this review. Instead, a deep learning algorithm uses its own neural network to check the accuracy of its results and then learn from them.
A deep learning algorithm’s neural network is a structure of algorithms that are layered to replicate the structure of the human brain. Accordingly, the neural network learns how to get better at a task over time without engineers providing it with feedback.

The two major stages of a neural network’s development are training and inference. Training is the initial stage in which the deep learning algorithm is provided with a data set and tasked with interpreting what that data set represents. 
Engineers then provide the neural network with feedback about the accuracy of its interpretation, and it adjusts accordingly. There may be many iterations of this process. 
Inference is when the neural network is deployed and is able to take a data set it has never seen before and make accurate predictions about what it represents.

**# Supervised Learning**

In supervised learning, the ML algorithm is given a small training dataset to work with. This training dataset is a smaller part of the bigger dataset and serves to give the algorithm a basic idea of the problem, solution, and data points to be dealt with. The training dataset is also very similar to the final dataset in its characteristics and provides the algorithm with the labeled parameters required for the problem.
The algorithm then finds relationships between the parameters given, essentially establishing a cause and effect relationship between the variables in the dataset. At the end of the training, the algorithm has an idea of how the data works and the relationship between the input and the output.

**# Unsupervised Learning**

Unsupervised machine learning holds the advantage of being able to work with unlabeled data. This means that human labor is not required to make the dataset machine-readable, allowing much larger datasets to be worked on by the program.
In supervised learning, the labels allow the algorithm to find the exact nature of the relationship between any two data points. However, unsupervised learning does not have labels to work off of, resulting in the creation of hidden structures.

**#Types of ML Classification Algorithms**

**Classification Algorithms can be further divided into the Mainly two category:

Linear Models

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machines

Non-linear Models

K-Nearest Neighbours

Kernel SVM

Naïve Bayes

Decision Tree Classification

Random Forest Classification**
